1. Me, NNPA, qgis2web, not here to talk about that

2. Live in the middle of nowhere (Zoomstack)

3. Greenhaugh First School

4. Closure

5. How could I help? Maps: increased travel to school; petitions

6. Ross at FOSS4GUK 2018 - origin-destination lines, raised into third 
   dimension, as it connotes a journey, and reduces cognitive load in 
   interpreting the map

7. Do what he did but in QGIS

8. Data is postcodes of pupil addresses (point geometry)

9. Origin-destination maps are lines, not points

10. Could create a new layer, and generate lines between these points and the 
    location of the school

11. Separate data from style (web design) - if data changes, don't have to rerun
    all sorts of processes each time
   
12. How? Geometry generators

13.
