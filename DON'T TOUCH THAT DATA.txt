DON'T TOUCH THAT DATA

INTRO

1. Me, NNPA, qgis2web, not here to talk about that

2. * Live in the middle of nowhere (Zoomstack)

3. * Greenhaugh First School

4. Closure

5. How could I help? Maps: increased travel to school; petitions

TRAVEL TO SCHOOL

6. * Ross at FOSS4GUK 2018 - origin-destination lines, raised into third 
   dimension, as it connotes a journey, and reduces cognitive load in 
   interpreting the map

7. Do what he did but in QGIS

8. Data is postcodes of pupil addresses (point geometry)

9. * Origin-destination maps are lines, not points (ECOLOGICAL ATLAS OF THE 
   BERING, CHUKCHI, AND BEAUFORT SEAS, Daniel P Huffman)

10. Could create a new layer, and generate lines between these points and the 
    location of the school

11. Separate data from style (web design) - if data changes, don't have to 
    rerun all sorts of processes each time
   
12. * How? Geometry generators (line with in situ gradient profile, by Régis 
    Haubourg)

13. * Draw line between the origin and destination using an expression

14. * * Curve it (thanks to Ross and Nathan Saylor for techniques/code)

15. * Add shadow

16. * Blur shadow

17. * Label and caption (not v successful)

PETITION

18. * * * Weakness for isometrics

19. * Had seen amazing Craig Taylor map

20. *Thought 2.5D renderer might work (Nicholas Duggan)

21. 2.5D renderer only works with polygons, not points
